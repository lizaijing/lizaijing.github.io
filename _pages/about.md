Hi, I'm Zaijing Li (ÊùéÂú®‰∫¨ in Chinese). I'm currently working toward the PhD degree with the School of Computer Science and Technology, [Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Liqiang Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io/), and I collaborate closely with Prof. [Rui Shao](https://rshaojimmy.github.io/) and Prof. [Dongmei Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Awsue7sAAAAJ). Prior to my Ph.D., I received a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in 2020, and a Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in 2023. My research interests predominantly lie in the fields of affective computing, multimodal large language model, reinforcement learning, and open world agents.
